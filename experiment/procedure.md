## Procedure

**The experiment entitled "Calibration of orifice plate" is performed into different steps which are listed below.**
1. Fan in the duct will be started.
2. Speed of the air at another end of the duct will be measured by anemometer by traversing method.
3. Pressure difference will be taken at two places by the U tube manometer as described in Figure1. The places are before orifice plate and after orifice plate.
4. Area of the duct opening will be measured from the diameter of the duct by measuring tape.
5. The quantity of the air following through the duct will be varying by changing the throttling devices which are place at the side of the duct where the fan is situated into the duct.
6. Five reading i.e. air velocity and pressure different will be taken by varying air quantity with changing the throttling device.

## Simulator Procedure

The following procedure is to be followed by the user in order to determine the coefficient of discharge of orifice plate in a duct:

Click on the button "start experiment" to start the experiment.
